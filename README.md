## AI Use on This Assignment

Use whichever mode matches where you are with this material. Both are fine,
and most people move between them as a concept clicks.

**Tutor mode.** The AI explains, questions, quizzes, and critiques, and you
write every line you submit. For this assignment that means asking it what the
three numbers in `range()` do, or having it quiz you until you can predict
what your own loop will print. Ask it a hundred questions — that is the whole
point. What you do not do is ask it for the function. Paste this at the start
of a chat and it will hold for the rest of the conversation:

> You are acting as a tutor. Your job is to explain what this coding question
> is asking, clarify confusing wording, and highlight the relevant concepts I
> need to know — but do not provide the full solution or code that directly
> answers the question. Instead, rephrase the problem in simpler terms,
> identify what is being tested, and suggest what steps or thought processes
> might help. Ask me guiding questions to make sure I am thinking critically.
> Do not write the final function, algorithm, or code implementation.

**Implementer mode.** You write a specification first, the AI writes code from
it, and then you verify that code line by line. For this assignment your spec
must say, for every loop, where it starts, where it stops, and whether the
last value is included. If what comes back does more than you asked for,
reject it — over-delivery is a defect, and catching it is part of the job.

You own every line either way, and you will be asked to explain it.

## Setup

Work in `development/mod-1`. Make a draft branch before you start.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
git checkout -b draft
```

Run `pytest` for everything, or `pytest -k fizzbuzz` for one question. Every
push runs the tests on GitHub and reports your score in the **Actions** tab.

75% of tests passing counts as complete. Submit at that point even if it is
not perfect. Treat submitting as a checkpoint rather than a finish line, and
come back to improve it.

## Before You Start

You will see a *lot* of similar loops in these problems. You may want to copy
and paste, and *ordinarily* that is fine. Not here. We want you to build some
muscle memory with `for` loops, so please write each "from scratch" question
out by hand. Loops turn up in a huge number of algorithm challenges, and we
want you to get so good at writing them it is literally boring.

Also, READ THE TESTS CAREFULLY, the limits are exact. If a description
confuses you, do what the *test* says. Remember that **inclusive** means
"include the number" and **exclusive** means "do NOT include the number". So
inclusive 1 to exclusive 5 is 1, 2, 3, 4. Exclusive 5 to inclusive 10 is 6, 7,
8, 9, 10.

Python has no C-style `for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)`. You use `range()`
instead, which takes up to three numbers: where to start, where to stop, and
what to count by.

```python
range(5)          # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(2, 5)       # 2, 3, 4
range(0, 10, 2)   # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
range(5, 0, -1)   # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

**The stop value is never included**, which is `range()` being exclusive at
the end. That catches everyone once. To finish on 10, you stop at 11.

Most of these questions **print** rather than return. The tests read what you
printed, so a returned value will not count.

## From Scratch

Write your solutions in `src/from_scratch.py`.

### Question 1: `loop_0_up_to_10`

Write a `for` loop that starts on 0 and prints each number up to, but not
including, 10. Count up by 1.

### Question 2: `loop_5_to_10`

Write a `for` loop that starts on 5 and prints each number up to, and
including, 10. Count up by 1.

Remember `range()` stops before its second number. So what do you pass to
finish on 10?

### Question 3: `loop_even_numbers_up_to_10`

Write a `for` loop that starts on 0 and prints each *even* number up to, but
not including, 10. What should you count by?

- 0 counts as an even number here
- an `if` check with `continue` would *technically* work, but it is overkill.
  Is there a simpler way? The tests confirm you did not use either

### Question 4: `countdown_5_to_0`

Write a `for` loop that starts on 5 and prints each number down to, and
including, 0. Count down by 1.

Counting down means all three numbers in `range()` change. Which one makes it
go backwards?

### Question 5: `loop_up_to_num`

Write a `for` loop that starts on 0 and prints each number up to, but not
including, a given `num` argument. Count up by 1.

```python
loop_up_to_num(3)   # prints 0, 1, 2
loop_up_to_num(0)   # prints nothing
```

Check the test for how this should behave when given 0 or a negative number.

### Question 6: `fizzbuzz`

Write a `for` loop that prints every number from 1 to 100, with three
exceptions:

- multiples of 3 print `"fizz"`
- multiples of 5 print `"buzz"`
- multiples of **both** print `"fizzbuzz"`

```text
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
...
```

Order matters here. If you check 3 before checking both, 15 never prints
`"fizzbuzz"`. This question comes up in real interviews more than it has any
right to, so it's worth getting comfortable with. Don't overthink it!

### Question 7: `count_vowels`

Write a function `count_vowels` that takes a string `word` and a boolean
`include_y` that defaults to `False`. It should return how many vowels the
word contains, in either case.

```python
count_vowels("hello")
# 2
count_vowels("rhythm")
# 0
count_vowels("rhythm", True)
# 1
count_vowels("AEIOU")
# 5
```

A `for` loop over a string gives you one character at a time, so this is the
first question here that loops over something other than a `range()`. Keep a
count as you go and return it once the loop is finished.

Recall: `include_y` needs a default value, because the tests call this with
only a word.

### Question 8: `halving_steps`

Write a function `halving_steps` that takes a number and returns how many
times you can halve it before it drops below 1.

```python
halving_steps(8)
# 4
halving_steps(1)
# 1
halving_steps(0.5)
# 0
```

Work through `8` by hand: 8 becomes 4, then 2, then 1, then 0.5. That is four
halvings, and the fourth is the one that took it under 1.

You cannot write this with `range()`, because you do not know how many
halvings it will take until you start. That is the question a `while` loop
answers: keep going while something is still true. The tests check you used
one.

## Modify

Change the two functions already in `src/modify.py`.

### Question 9: `while_to_for`

Rewrite `while_to_for` as a `for` loop with `range()`. It currently prints 0
to 4 using a `while` loop and a counter it has to increment by hand. The
output stays exactly the same, and the tests check the `while` is gone.

### Question 10: `continue_guard_clause`

Add a guard clause to `continue_guard_clause` so that 2 and 3 are skipped
entirely, printing nothing at all for them. It currently prints a message and
a number for 1 through 4.

A **guard clause** here is an `if` that runs `continue`. `continue` abandons
the current trip through the loop and starts the next one, skipping the rest
of the body. The tests check you used it.

## Debug

### Question 11: `broken_loop`

`broken_loop(start, end)` should build a string of every number from `start`
to `end`, **including** `end`. It currently skips every other number and stops
one short.

```python
broken_loop(1, 10)   # want "12345678910"
broken_loop(0, 0)    # want "0"
broken_loop(0, -1)   # want ""
```

Both problems are in the `range()` call. Note the last two cases: a range that
covers one number, and a range that covers none.

### Question 12: `broken_nested`

`broken_nested` should build `"00-01-02-...-18-19"`, joining each outer number
to each inner one. It returns doubled digits instead.

```python
broken_nested()   # want "00-01-02-03-04-05-06-07-08-09-10-11-...-19"
```

Look closely at the two loop variables. What happens to the outer one while
the inner loop is running?

## Submitting

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

Pushing runs the tests on GitHub. Check the **Actions** tab for your score,
then open a pull request to your instructor for feedback.

## Good luck!

Off-by-one errors are a rite of passage. When a loop misbehaves, print the
counter and watch what it actually does. You got this!
