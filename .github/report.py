"""Turn pytest's JUnit XML into a score the student and the gradebook can read.

Writes two things from one source:

  1. A table appended to the Actions job summary, which is what the student
     reads after a push.
  2. A commit status under the context "marcy/score", which is what the
     gradebook collector reads back through the API.

Both come from the same XML, so they cannot disagree.
